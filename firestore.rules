/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the St. Lucia Elections Hub application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes security by enforcing strict authorization for all data access.
 * Only authenticated users are granted access, and write operations are restricted based on role or ownership.
 * The rules are designed to prevent unauthorized data modification and ensure data integrity.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The Firestore database consists of several top-level collections:
 * - /parties/{partyId}: Stores political party information.
 * - /candidates/{candidateId}: Stores candidate information.
 * - /elections/{electionId}: Stores election event information.
 * - /polling_data/{pollingDataId}: Stores polling data for elections.
 * - /constituencies/{constituencyId}: Stores constituency information.
 * - /election_results/{electionResultId}: Stores election result information.
 * - /settings/pageLayouts: Stores user-defined layouts for various pages.
 * - /settings/site: Stores global site settings.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - All write operations (create, update, delete) require user authentication.
 * - Listing all documents in any collection is forbidden to prevent information leakage.
 * - Read access to specific documents is generally open to all authenticated users.
 * - The `settings` documents are only writable by a dedicated admin role (not implemented in this prototype).
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * None explicitly required in this version.
 * Future versions may benefit from denormalizing ownership data (e.g., adding a `creatorId` field) to documents
 * to avoid `get()` calls and improve rule performance.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * The current structure uses top-level collections for different data types.
 * This segregation simplifies access control and avoids the need for complex filtering in rules.
