/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the political data platform.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes secure data access based on a combination of factors:
 *  - For most collections, only authenticated users can read or write data.
 *  - Certain collections, such as `party_logos`, allow public read access.
 *  - No collection allows completely open write access. Write operations always require authentication.
 *  - Data validation is relaxed to enable rapid prototyping and iteration.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The Firestore database is structured as follows:
 * - Top-level collections store core data entities like parties, candidates, elections, etc.
 * - A `/settings` document stores global site settings and page layouts.
 * - User activity is stored under the `/user_activity` collection.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is generally disallowed to protect user privacy.
 * - The `party_logos` collection is publicly readable to allow the display of party logos without authentication.
 * - Default security posture for ambiguous relationships is strict: deny access unless explicitly granted.
