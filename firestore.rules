/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes secure access control based on user authentication and role-based authorization.
 * It aims to protect data integrity and prevent unauthorized access.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - Top-level collections are used to store data for various entities like candidates, parties, elections, etc.
 * - There is no user specific data or structure in this application.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Global reads are enabled for several collections to facilitate public data consumption.
 * - Write access to most collections is restricted.
 * - Mailing list subscribers can be deleted by admins only.
