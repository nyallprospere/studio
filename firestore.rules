/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Revolucianize application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes security by enforcing strict authorization checks
 * for all write operations and implementing appropriate read restrictions
 * based on the data's purpose (public vs. private). Data shape validation is relaxed to allow for rapid prototyping.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The Firestore database is organized into top-level collections for major
 * entities like parties, candidates, constituencies, and elections.
 * There are also specific singleton documents for site-wide settings and page layouts.
 * User-specific data is stored in the `/user_activity/{activityId}` collection.
 * News articles and comments are stored in a hierarchical structure under `/news/{newsId}/comments/{commentId}`.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Global read access is granted to collections like constituencies, parties, and elections,
 *   as this information is considered public.
 * - Write access to all collections is restricted to authenticated users only.
 * - The `/settings/pageLayouts` and `/settings/site` documents are write-protected.
 * - User listing is generally disallowed to protect user privacy.
 * - Deletion of documents is generally disallowed unless the document is owned by the user.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  N/A
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 *  N/A
