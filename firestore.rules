/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the St. Lucia Elections Hub application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset provides open read access to all collections and restricts write access. This facilitates prototyping and data exploration while preventing unauthorized modifications.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The database consists of top-level collections for parties, candidates, elections, polling data, constituencies, and election results. A single document stores page layout settings.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Read access is open to all users (including unauthenticated users).
 * - Write access is denied to all users.
 * - All collections are treated as independent data silos, simplifying authorization.
 *
 * WARNING: These rules provide open read access and should be refined before deployment.
