/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the political data application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes security and data ownership, enforcing strict access controls based on authentication.
 * All write operations (create, update, delete) require authentication and proper authorization.
 * Read operations (get, list) are more permissive in some cases but are carefully controlled to prevent unauthorized access to private data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The Firestore database is organized into several top-level collections, including 'parties', 'events', 'candidates', 'elections', etc.
 * Some collections, like 'user_activity', are designed to store user-specific data.
 * Subcollections are used to nest related data, such as 'comments' under 'news' articles.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is generally disallowed to protect user privacy.
 * - Public read access is granted to some collections (e.g., 'news') where the data is intended to be publicly available. However, writes to these collections are restricted to authorized users.
 * - All potentially sensitive data collections require authentication.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * This ruleset avoids `get()` calls by ensuring that documents contain all necessary data for authorization. For example, if a document needs to be owned by a user, it must contain a field with the user's ID.
