/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Revolucianize application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes secure access to data while allowing flexible data shapes during prototyping.
 * Read access is generally open where appropriate, while write access is strictly controlled to prevent unauthorized modifications.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The Firestore database consists of several top-level collections, each representing a core data entity (e.g., elections, parties, candidates).
 * Most collections use a simple document ID structure (e.g., /elections/{electionId}).
 * Data is generally not nested, and authorization relies on document-level checks.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Listing of elections is allowed for all users, including unauthenticated users, to enable public discovery of election information.
 * - Write access to all collections is generally restricted to prevent unauthorized data manipulation. Specific exceptions may exist based on the entity.
 * - Data validation is minimized during this prototyping phase to facilitate rapid iteration. Focus is placed on authorization checks rather than schema enforcement.
