/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for the application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes a public-read, restricted-write model. Most data is readable by all authenticated users.
 * Write access is generally restricted to prevent unauthorized data modification.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The Firestore database consists of several top-level collections. There are no user-specific data trees.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is generally disallowed.
 * - The `news` collection is publicly readable.
 * - Schema validation is relaxed to allow for rapid prototyping, focusing only on authorization-critical fields.
 * - Denormalization is not explicitly used.
