/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Revolucianize app.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes security by enforcing strict authorization. It focuses on preventing unauthorized data access and modification.
 * Data validation is relaxed to facilitate rapid prototyping and schema evolution.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The Firestore database is organized into top-level collections such as `parties`, `candidates`, `elections`, etc.
 * Subcollections are used for nested data, such as `news/{newsId}/comments/{commentId}`.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 *  - Access to `settings/pageLayouts` is open to authenticated users, as per the reported error. In a production environment, this would require further access controls.
 *  - Data validation is minimal, focusing on authorization and relationship integrity.
 *  - Listing operations are generally restricted unless explicitly allowed.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  - Currently, no denormalization is implemented in this ruleset. As the application evolves, consider adding denormalized fields to avoid `get()` calls in security rules.
 *    For example, if `tasks` belong to `projects`, add a `projectId` field to the `tasks` documents to avoid needing to fetch the `project` to authorize access to the `task`.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 *  - The ruleset does not currently implement structural segregation. If some data needs to be public and other data private, consider using separate collections.
