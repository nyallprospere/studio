/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict access control model for the Revolucianize platform.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - Top-level collections are used to store core entities like parties, elections, candidates, and news articles.
 * - Subcollections are used for comments on news articles.
 * - A /settings collection stores singleton documents for page layouts and site-wide settings.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - Mailing list subscribers can only be created.
 * - Most data is publicly readable but only modifiable by authenticated users (or, ideally, admin users in the future)
 *
 *  Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  - Several collections should ideally have an ownerId field (or similar) to simplify ownership checks.
 *  - The party_logos collection could benefit from having a partyId denormalized on each document to avoid needing to query parties documents during authorization.
