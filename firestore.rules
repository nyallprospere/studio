/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for St. Lucia Elections Hub application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset provides admin access to all logged-in users. This is suitable for
 * prototyping and internal testing. In a production environment, a more refined
 * role-based access control should be implemented.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The Firestore database consists of several top-level collections: 'parties',
 * 'events', 'candidates', 'elections', 'polling_data', 'constituencies',
 * 'election_results', and 'settings'. Each collection stores data related to
 * its respective entity. The 'settings' collection contains single documents
 * for 'pageLayouts' and 'site'.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - All authenticated users are treated as admins and have full read and write
 *   access to all collections. This simplifies development but is not suitable
 *   for production.
 * - List operations are generally allowed to facilitate data retrieval by the
 *   application.
 * - Data validation is minimal, focusing on authorization rather than schema
 *   enforcement, to enable rapid prototyping.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization: N/A (Admin access granted to all logged-in users)
 * Structural Segregation: Data is separated into collections based on entity type.
