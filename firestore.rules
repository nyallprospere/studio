/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a secure access model for a political website,
 * controlling access to various collections like parties, candidates, elections, and news.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - Top-level collections are used for entities like parties, candidates, and elections.
 * - Subcollections are used for comments on news articles, nested under specific articles.
 * - A 'settings' document exists to hold global site settings and page layouts.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public read access is granted to most top-level collections to allow open data consumption.
 * - Write access to top-level collections is restricted to authenticated users.
 * - No data validation is enforced beyond what's strictly required for authorization.
 * - The /reports collection allows listing by all users with authentication, but denies all write operations.
