/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for the political commentary application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes secure data access based on clearly defined ownership and roles.
 * Data validation is relaxed to facilitate rapid prototyping.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The Firestore database is organized into top-level collections for core entities
 * such as parties, candidates, events, elections, constituencies, and news articles.
 * User-specific data (user activity, user maps) is stored in top-level collections.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Data validation is minimized in favor of rapid prototyping.  Only essential authorization
 *   and relational integrity checks are performed.
 * - No user listing is allowed to prevent data scraping.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  - No external data is used for authorization decisions. All necessary data for
 * authorization is present within the document being secured.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 *  - Drafts and published content are not segregated.
