/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the St. Lucia Elections Hub application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset prioritizes data security by enforcing strict
 * access controls on all data stored in Firestore. It assumes a public-read,
 * owner-write model for most top-level collections.  It provides a public read access to the `/settings/pageLayouts` document.
 *
 * Data Structure: The database comprises several top-level collections:
 *   /parties/{partyId}: Stores political party information.
 *   /candidates/{candidateId}: Stores candidate information.
 *   /elections/{electionId}: Stores election event information.
 *   /polling_data/{pollingDataId}: Stores polling data for elections.
 *   /constituencies/{constituencyId}: Stores constituency information.
 *   /election_results/{electionResultId}: Stores election result information.
 *   /settings/pageLayouts: Stores layout settings for pages.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 *   - Public read access is enabled for all top-level collections
 *   - Write access to all collections is denied without authentication (as a base).
 *   - The `settings/pageLayouts` document is publicly readable.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:  None. This ruleset assumes no denormalized data
 * is required for authorization decisions given the current data model.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:  The segregation of data into separate top-level collections
 * based on entity type (parties, candidates, elections, etc.) inherently supports
 * structural segregation. This allows for the application of distinct security
 * rules to each collection based on its specific access requirements.
