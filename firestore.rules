/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the St. Lucia Elections Hub application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset provides open read access to all collections and restricts write access. Write access will be configured for authenticated users only.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /parties/{partyId}: Stores information about political parties.
 * - /candidates/{candidateId}: Stores information about candidates.
 * - /elections/{electionId}: Stores information about elections.
 * - /polling_data/{pollingDataId}: Stores polling data for elections.
 * - /constituencies/{constituencyId}: Stores information about constituencies.
 * - /election_results/{electionResultId}: Stores election results.
 * - /settings/pageLayouts: Stores layout configurations for pages. This is a singleton document.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Read access is generally open (get, list) to facilitate data accessibility.
 * - Write access (create, update, delete) requires authentication and is restricted to the document owner, where applicable.
 * - Listing is enabled for all collections.
