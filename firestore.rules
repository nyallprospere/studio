/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a public-read, owner-write model for most collections,
 *              allowing anyone to read data but restricting modifications to authorized users.
 *              It prioritizes security by default, denying access unless explicitly allowed.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - Top-level collections: /parties, /party_logos, /events, /candidates, /archived_candidates,
 *                          /elections, /polling_data, /constituencies, /election_results,
 *                          /user_activity, /regions, /user_maps.
 * - Single document settings: /settings/pageLayouts, /settings/site.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Read-only collections: The /constituencies, /elections, /parties collections are intended to be publicly readable.
 * - Single document settings: The /settings/pageLayouts and /settings/site documents are publicly readable.
 * - Write restrictions: Write access to all collections is restricted to authenticated users.
 * - User activity: Logged in users can create user activity entries.
 *
 * Access Control Patterns:
 * - Public Read with Owner-Only Writes: /candidates, /archived_candidates, /events, /polling_data, /election_results, /user_activity, /user_maps.
 * - Public Read: /parties, /constituencies, /elections
 * - Public Read for Single Documents: /settings/pageLayouts, /settings/site
