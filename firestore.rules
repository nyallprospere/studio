/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Revolucianize application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes strong authorization. It enforces data access controls based on simple patterns.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The Firestore database contains several top-level collections, each representing a distinct data entity.
 * Documents within these collections are generally identified by a unique ID.
 * Some collections, like `/news/{newsId}/comments/{commentId}`, are nested.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Site Settings and Page Layouts are readable by everyone but not editable.
 * - All other collections are writeable by anyone who is signed in.
 *
