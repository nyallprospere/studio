/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the political data application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes secure data access with an emphasis on explicit authorization.
 * It allows public read access to most collections but restricts write access to prevent unauthorized data modification.
 * Strict ownership is enforced where applicable.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The Firestore database contains collections for parties, candidates, constituencies, elections,
 * polling data, election results, site settings, user activity, regions, and user-created maps.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public read access is granted for collections like parties, candidates, constituencies, and elections to allow
 *   unauthenticated users to view the data.
 * - Write access to these collections is generally denied to prevent unauthorized modifications.
 * - The `settings` documents are read-only.
 * - User-specific data like `user_activity` and `user_maps` are stored with document-level ownership.
 * - Listing of the `mailing_list_subscribers` collection is denied for privacy.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Not explicitly used in this initial ruleset, but can be applied in the future. For instance, to secure a subcollection of `/parties/{partyId}`,
 *   the role of the current user could be denormalized onto the party document itself (e.g., `parties/{partyId}.members[request.auth.uid] == 'admin'`).
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - The `user_activity` collection implicitly segregates public and private data by storing activity logs separately
 *   from core political data.
