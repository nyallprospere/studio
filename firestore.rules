/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for the Revolucianize political data platform.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset provides public read access to most data collections while restricting write access.
 * Only authenticated users can create, update, or delete data, and specific conditions are enforced
 * to ensure data integrity and ownership (where applicable).
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The Firestore database consists of several top-level collections (e.g., /parties, /candidates, /elections).
 * Each collection stores specific data entities as described in the backend.json.
 * There is also the settings collection with two documents within (pageLayouts and site).
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public read access is granted to the /regions collection, allowing any user (signed in or not) to read
 *   the region list.
 * - All write operations are restricted to authenticated users (`isSignedIn()`).
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The current data model does not require denormalization.  All write rules are simple and based on the user being signed in.
