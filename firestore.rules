/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes security by enforcing explicit access control for each
 * collection. It focuses on protecting data based on user authentication and
 * ownership, while keeping data structure validation minimal for rapid prototyping.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The Firestore database contains collections for various entities such as parties,
 * candidates, elections, constituencies, and user-generated content like user maps.
 * Global settings and page layouts are stored in singleton documents within the `/settings` collection.
 * All top level collections are intended to be publicly readable.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is generally disallowed unless explicitly required.
 * - Strict ownership is enforced for user-generated content and settings.
 * - Read-only access is granted for certain collections like global site settings.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  - No external data from other documents or collections is required to validate authorization.
