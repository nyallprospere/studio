/**
 * @file Overview
 * This ruleset enforces a role-based access control model with specific restrictions based on the collection.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The database consists of several top-level collections, including 'parties', 'events', 'candidates', 'elections', 'polling_data', 'constituencies', 'election_results', 'user_activity', 'regions', 'party_logos', 'archived_candidates' and a 'settings' document, and a subcollection for 'pageLayouts' and 'site' settings.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 *  - Read access is generally public for most collections.
 *  - Write access to collections is restricted and requires an authenticated user.
 *  - The 'settings' document is read only for unauthenticated users
 *  - The regions Collection is writable by authenticated users
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  - No explicit denormalization is used in this basic prototype. More advanced scenarios might require denormalizing user roles or ownership information directly into documents.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 *  - No structural segregation is implemented.
