/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules
 * @version 2
 * @description This ruleset enforces a public read policy with restricted write access based on the document type.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - Top-level collections: /parties, /events, /candidates, /archived_candidates, /elections, /polling_data, /constituencies, /election_results, /regions, /ads, /news, /reports, /user_maps, /mailing_list_subscribers.
 * - Singleton documents under /settings: /settings/pageLayouts, /settings/site.
 * - Subcollection: /news/{newsId}/comments/{commentId}.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public read access to most collections (parties, events, candidates, archived_candidates, elections, polling_data, constituencies, election_results, regions, ads, news) to allow for open data consumption.
 * - Write access to most collections is denied by default due to lack of defined roles or ownership and for prototyping simplicity.  These MUST be locked down properly in production.
 * - Singleton documents under /settings are write-protected.
 * - User-generated content is not explicitly scoped to a user; write access is generally denied for prototyping reasons.
