/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes a secure-by-default posture, restricting write access unless explicitly allowed.
 * Public read access is granted to certain collections where it aligns with the data model.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The Firestore database consists of several top-level collections: parties, events, candidates, constituencies,
 * elections, polling data, and others. Some collections, like news, have subcollections (e.g., comments).
 * There is a special /settings document to store global information
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed across all collections to protect user privacy.
 * - The /settings document is read-only for all users.
 * - Strict ownership is enforced for user-specific data (none defined in the IR).
 * - The default security posture for ambiguous relationships is to deny access.
