/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the St. Lucia Elections Hub application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset provides a baseline level of security. All collections are protected, requiring a verified user to perform any write operation.
 * It assumes that any unauthenticated user's request is denied, while authenticated users have more access.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The Firestore database consists of several top-level collections: `parties`, `candidates`, `elections`, `polling_data`, `constituencies`, and `election_results`.
 * Each collection stores data related to its namesake entity.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - No user listing is allowed to protect user privacy.
 * - All write operations require authentication. This is a security baseline that must be improved upon.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  - The data model currently avoids the need for denormalization. All collections are top-level and access is granted based on the user being authenticated.
