/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Revolucianize app.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes security by default, enforcing strict
 * access control. Most data is only readable and writable by
 * authenticated users. Public read access is granted only to a few top-level
 * collections where that is explicitly intended.  The rules DO NOT
 * perform strong data validation beyond authorization checks.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The Firestore database is structured with top-level collections
 * such as /parties, /candidates, /elections, and others.  Some
 * collections, like /user_activity, store data related to specific users.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is generally disallowed to protect user privacy.
 * - Data validation is minimized in favor of rapid prototyping. Only authorization-critical fields are validated.
 * - Read-only collections are not explicitly defined, but could be implemented by denying write access.
 * - The default security posture is to deny all access unless explicitly allowed.
 * - Ads data is considered public, to be displayed on the website.
