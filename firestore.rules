/**
 * @description This ruleset enforces a role-based access control model.
 * All data is stored in top-level collections.
 * Key Security Decisions:
 *  - Only authenticated users can access any data.
 *  - The `settings` documents can only be read or written by an admin.
 *  - Other collections are open for reads but require authentication for writes.
 *  - Subcollections inherit parent permissions where applicable (comments under news articles).
