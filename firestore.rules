/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the political data app.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes secure data access based on user roles and data ownership.
 * Read access is generally open where appropriate, while write access is strictly controlled.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The database stores information about political parties, candidates, elections, and related data.
 * Data is organized into top-level collections such as `/parties`, `/candidates`, `/elections`, etc.
 * Some data is nested in subcollections (e.g., `/news/{newsId}/comments/{commentId}`).
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is generally disallowed to protect privacy.
 * - Public read access is enabled for some collections (e.g., `/parties`) to allow for open data consumption.
 * - Reports can only be read.
