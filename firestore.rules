/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the St. Lucia Elections Hub application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset grants full access to all authenticated users ("admin-like functionality").
 * While this is insecure for a production environment, it enables rapid prototyping
 * and development by removing authorization barriers.  It is CRITICAL to replace
 * these permissive rules with a more restrictive model before launch.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The database consists of several top-level collections: 'parties', 'candidates',
 * 'elections', 'polling_data', 'constituencies', 'election_results', and 'settings'.
 * Each collection stores documents related to its respective entity.  The 'settings'
 * collection contains a single document 'pageLayouts' storing user-defined page layouts.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - All authenticated users have full read and write access to all collections.
 * - This is a deliberate choice for prototyping and MUST be revisited for production.
 * - No data validation is performed in this initial ruleset to allow for flexible
 *   data shapes during development.
