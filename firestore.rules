/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Revolucianize project.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes secure data access based on a combination of public read access for some collections (e.g., news articles, constituencies) and owner-only or authenticated-user-only write access for other collections (e.g., user activity, mailing list subscribers).
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The Firestore database contains several top-level collections representing different aspects of the application, including political parties, candidates, elections, news articles, user activity, and site settings. Some collections have subcollections (e.g., comments under news articles).
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Most data is publicly readable to allow for a seamless user experience.
 * - Write access to most collections is restricted to authenticated users.
 * - The `reports` collection is only writeable, not readable, by any client.
 * - Data validation is minimized in this prototyping phase to allow for rapid iteration. Only relational integrity is validated.
 *
 * Access Control Pattern Summary:
 * - Public Read, Restricted Write: `parties`, `candidates`, `elections`, `constituencies`, `news`, `ads`
 * - Authenticated User Write: `mailing_list_subscribers`, `user_activity`, `user_maps`
 * - Reports collection is only writeable by any client.
