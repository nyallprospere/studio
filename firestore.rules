/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the St. Lucia Elections Hub application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes Authorization Independence by avoiding hierarchical
 * authorization dependencies and denormalizing data where necessary. Data is
 * segregated into collections based on their access requirements. The rules
 * generally allow public read access while restricting write access to
 * authenticated users.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The Firestore database contains several top-level collections:
 * - /parties/{partyId}: Stores information about political parties.
 * - /candidates/{candidateId}: Stores information about candidates.
 * - /elections/{electionId}: Stores information about elections.
 * - /polling_data/{pollingDataId}: Stores polling data for elections.
 * - /constituencies/{constituencyId}: Stores information about constituencies.
 * - /election_results/{electionResultId}: Stores election results.
 * - /settings/site: Stores sitewide settings (per the error trace)
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public read access is generally allowed for all collections.
 * - Write access is restricted to authenticated users.
 * - No user-specific data trees or subcollections are present, simplifying
 *   the rules.
 * - The 'settings/site' document is explicitly allowed for public read access to resolve the reported error.
