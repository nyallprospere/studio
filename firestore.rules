/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the St. Lucia Elections Hub application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict access control model. Only authenticated users can read or write data.
 * Administrative access is not explicitly defined, so all write operations are initially denied.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The Firestore database consists of several top-level collections:
 * - /parties/{partyId}: Stores political party information.
 * - /candidates/{candidateId}: Stores candidate information.
 * - /elections/{electionId}: Stores election event information.
 * - /polling_data/{pollingDataId}: Stores polling data.
 * - /constituencies/{constituencyId}: Stores constituency information.
 * - /election_results/{electionResultId}: Stores election results.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - No public read access: All `get` and `list` operations require authentication.
 * - No default write access: All `create`, `update`, and `delete` operations are initially denied to all users.
 * - No administrative roles defined: The ruleset does not implement special permissions for admin users.
 *   All collections require specific authorization logic to be added for write access.
