/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for the St. Lucia Elections Hub application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset provides public read access to all data while restricting write access to prevent unauthorized modifications.
 * This approach prioritizes ease of data access for all users while ensuring data integrity.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The Firestore database consists of several top-level collections: `parties`, `events`, `candidates`, `elections`, `polling_data`, `constituencies`, and `election_results`.
 * There are also two singleton documents under the `/settings` collection, `pageLayouts` and `site`.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public Read Access: All `get` and `list` operations are allowed for all collections. This simplifies data retrieval for the application.
 * - Restricted Write Access: All `create`, `update`, and `delete` operations are denied. This prevents unauthorized users from modifying the data.
 * - Singleton Documents: The `pageLayouts` and `site` documents under the `/settings` collection follow the same public read and restricted write access pattern.
